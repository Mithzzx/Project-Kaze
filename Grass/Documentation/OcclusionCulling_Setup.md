# Grass Occlusion Culling System

I have implemented a GPU-based Occlusion Culling system for your grass renderer. This system uses the Camera's Depth Texture to cull grass blades that are hidden behind other objects (like terrain, buildings, or large rocks), improving performance.

## How it works

1.  **Depth Texture Access**: The system accesses the `_CameraDepthTexture` generated by URP.
2.  **Compute Shader Check**: In the `CSCull` kernel, each grass blade's position is projected to screen space.
3.  **Depth Comparison**: The shader samples the depth texture at the grass's screen position and compares it with the grass's distance from the camera.
4.  **Culling**: If the grass is significantly behind the depth value (occluded), it is removed from the draw buffer.

## Setup Requirements

For this to work, you **MUST** ensure the Depth Texture is enabled in your URP settings:

1.  Go to your **URP Asset** (usually in `Settings/` or `Rendering/`).
2.  Find the **General** or **Lighting** section.
3.  Ensure **Depth Texture** is checked/enabled.

## Parameters

I added new parameters to the `GrassRenderer` component:

*   **Use Occlusion Culling**: Toggles the system on/off.
*   **Occlusion Bias**: A small offset (default 0.1) to prevent grass from flickering or disappearing when it's very close to the ground or other objects. Increase this if you see grass flickering on the terrain surface.

## Technical Details

*   **File Modified**: `Assets/Scripts/GrassRenderer.cs`
*   **Shader Modified**: `Assets/Shaders/GrassCompute.compute`
*   **Method**: Hi-Z style point sampling (single sample at grass center).
*   **Platform Support**: Handles `Reversed-Z` (DX11/12, Metal, Consoles) and standard Z (OpenGL) automatically.
